The HKS CAMP, known around the world as Computerized Au-tomobile Multi Player, debuted in 1996 as the first monitoring system of its kind. The HKS CAMP was designed as a graphical data display enabling end users to interface the CAMP system connected to the factory ECM to a heads up audio/video dis-play to monitor, in real-time scenario, multiple information from various engine parameters. The HKS CAMP system was considered a revolutionary unit at a time when entry-level in-line fuel pumps and rise rate fuel pressure regulators were considered high-tech fuel management for the import tuner world.
